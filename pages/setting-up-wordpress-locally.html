		<h2>What are we doing?</h2>
		<p>
			We want to set up WordPress on our machine. We want to build websites in a professional manner, but we
			want to do it fast and deliverable. So it would behoove us to work on our personal computer
			on our local networks to start off. Then once we build the site we can figure out how to deploy it in a safe,
			secure, and fast
			manner onto the internet to provide value to your clients.
		</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://learn.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">official WordPress documentation</a> suggests using an
			external host provider to get setup to follow their hands-on guides. With Docker and the instructions here,
			there's no need to do so. This is free and local.</p>

		<h2>How?</h2>
		<p>
			However, I'm winging this using practices I've learned from past work. One such practice was to
			have a Docker container with an isolated environment that we can access on our machine
			where we can just launch a command, and start working on our locally hosted WordPress site.
		</p>

		<h2>What do we need to begin?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Install Docker
			</li>
			<li>
				A Docker Compose file
			</li>
			<li>
				Very basic handling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">the command line</a>.
				I'll be using Terminal on MacOS.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Installing Docker</h2>
		<p>
			I use a Macbook, so I went ahead and installed Docker from
			<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" target="_blank">the official Docker download/install page</a>.
			You want to use the official docs when it comes to installing stuff, so read up.

		<h2>Using Docker Compose</h2>
		<p>
			Docker Compose is actually a tool integrated with Docker to streamline setting up
			and running containers. It will allow us to run a simple script to handle creating the container hosting WordPress
			for us.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, make a new directory called <code>wordpress</code>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mine is located at <code>/Users/jarett/Developer/wordpress</code>.
		</p>
		<img src="/assets/wordpress_location.webp" alt="Wordpress Location" width="1138" height="798">

		<p>
			Inside your <code>wordpress</code> folder, make a file named <code>docker-compose.yml</code>.
		</p>

		<p>Within <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, insert the following:</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: MyR00tMySQLPa$$5w0rD
      MYSQL_DATABASE: MyWordPressDatabaseName
      MYSQL_USER: MyWordPressUser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: Pa$$5w0rD
  wordpress:
    depends_on:
      - db
    image: wordpress:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: MyWordPressUser
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: Pa$$5w0rD
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: MyWordPressDatabaseName
    volumes:
      ["./:/var/www/html"]
volumes:
  mysql: {}

			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>
			Save the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, then run <code>docker compose up -d</code> in the command line
			within your
			wordpress directory.
		</p>
		<img src="/assets/running_docker_compose.webp" alt="Running Docker Compose" width="1134" height="798">
		<footer>You can definitely tell a new day passed when I was working on this guide.</footer>

		<p>
			What's happening here is that two containers are being built out with the services
			defined in our docker compose file. One for the WordPress application itself, and
			another for the MySQL database WordPress requires (note in the compose file, this is
			specifically written out with the <code>depends_on</code> keyword above).
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, we can visit <a href="http://localhost:8000" target="_blank">localhost:8000</a> in our browser. Since
			the container is working, this should bring you to your local WordPress instance we just
			setup.
		</p>
		<img src="/assets/local_wordpress_install.webp" alt="Wordpress Install" width="2878" height="1592">

		<p>
			Awesome! We did it! But there's a few things we can do to make this a bit more secure.
			Namely with the passwords we have explicitly written in our docker-compose file.
		</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: MyR00tMySQLPa$$5w0rD
MYSQL_DATABASE: MyWordPressDatabaseName
MYSQL_USER: MyWordPressUser
MYSQL_PASSWORD: Pa$$5w0rD
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>
			I got the contents for the docker compose file from <a
				href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/run-docker-wordpress" target="_blank">this handy tutorial</a>.
			However, having the <code>MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD</code> and <code>MYSQL_PASSWORD</code> values exposed as they are
			can set us up for trouble in the future if you're not careful.
		</p>

		<p>
			We will <i>definitely</i> want to change these values
			to something personal and private (preferably randomized with a reputable password generator such as <a
				href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>.
		</p>

		<p>Let's walk through how to obfuscate our passwords while still having a shareable docker compose file.</p>

		<h2>Securing Passwords</h2>

		<p>
			First, let's kill our container. An easy way to do this is through the Docker Dashboard.
			Click the little trash can icon next to our WordPress container. A prompt will appear asking if we want
			to delete the WordPress compose project forever. We sure do (for now!).
		</p>

		<img src="/assets/delete_forever.webp" alt="Deleting Container" width="2548" height="1436">
		<footer>Nothing lasts forever . . .</footer>

		<p>
			Poof. It's gone! But we'll get it back, better than ever.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, we're going to implement something called secrets. Essentially, we'll use these secret keys
			that will contain our passwords. But, instead of directly pasting our passwords into the compose file,
			we'll paste references to your passwords instead, which will be contained in separate text files on our machine.
			That way, the passwords will only be accessible from one place, and not freely out in the open.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, let's make a new folder within our WordPress directory called <code>secrets</code>. This is the folder
			where we'll store our passwords in individual text files.
		</p>

		<img src="/assets/secrets_folder_new.webp" alt="Secrets folder" width="1154" height="176">

		<p>
			Now lets make two new files named <code>mysql_root_password.txt</code> and <code>mysql_password.txt</code>. Put
			these in the
			secrets folder. Then add the respective passwords to the files (<code>MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD</code>'s value into
			<code>mysql_root_password.txt</code> and
			<code>MYSQL_PASSWORD</code>'s value into <code>mysql_password.txt</code>).
		</p>

		<p>
			A way to do this from the command line would look like this:
		<pre>
				<code>
echo "MyR00tMySQLPa$$5w0rD" > mysql_root_password.txt
echo "Pa$$5w0rD" > mysql_root_password.txt
				</code>
			</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
			Definitely choose different passwords. These are simply examples.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now back to your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. Edit it so it looks like the following:
		<pre>
				<code>
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: /run/secrets/mysql_root_password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: MyWordPressDatabaseName
      MYSQL_USER: MyWordPressUser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: /run/secrets/mysql_password
    secrets:
      - mysql_root_password
      - mysql_password
  wordpress:
    depends_on:
      - db
    image: wordpress:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: MyWordPressUser
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: /run/secrets/mysql_password
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: MyWordPressDatabaseName
    secrets:
      - mysql_password
    volumes:
      ["./:/var/www/html"]
secrets:
  mysql_root_password:
    file: ./secrets/mysql_root_password.txt
  mysql_password:
    file: ./secrets/mysql_password.txt
volumes:
  mysql: {}
				</code>
			</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
			We should bring our attention to this addition:
		<pre>
				<code>
secrets:
  mysql_root_password:
    file: ./secrets/mysql_root_password.txt
  mysql_password:
    file: ./secrets/mysql_password.txt
				</code>
			</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
			Here, we're telling Docker that we want to use secrets defined in specified .txt files and assign them
			variable names <code>mysql_root_password</code> and <code>mysql_password</code>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In both service entires we have in our docker-compose file, we must specify which of our
			new secrets we'd like to use. So for our database service, we're going to use both
			secrets, therefore we must give it a <code>secrets</code> entry telling it which secret
			variables we want to use, and then use them in place of our passwords.
		</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: /run/secrets/mysql_root_password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: MyWordPressDatabaseName
      MYSQL_USER: MyWordPressUser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: /run/secrets/mysql_password
    secrets:
      - mysql_root_password
      - mysql_password
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>
			Note that when we're replacing the hardcoded passwords with our secrets, we must prefix them with
			<code>/run/secrets/</code>.
			This tells Docker to open our text files with the secrets and use the contents within to send to the services.
		</p>

		<p>Same with the wordpress service. Both changes are needed in both services.</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
  wordpress:
    depends_on:
      - db
    image: wordpress:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: MyWordPressUser
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: /run/secrets/mysql_password
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: MyWordPressDatabaseName
    secrets:
      - mysql_password
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>
			Once those changes are implemented, we can rerun <code>docker compose up -d</code>.
			And voila! You should be able to go back to <a href="http://localhost:8000" target="_blank">localhost:8000</a>
			like before, but
			now with the passwords abstracted out of the code.
		</p>

		<p>
			We didn't set up any source control in this tutorial, but if you're curious, we would <i>not</i> share our secrets
			folder.
			If anyone wants to work alongside you, they would need to make a local text files with their own secret passwords.
		</p>
