		<h2>Departure</h2>
		<p>
			Last year, I quit my software engineering job. I was making the most money I've ever made
			in my life, and it's likely I won't ever reach that sort of income again for a while if at all, but I
			had already started counting down the months, weeks, and days until I was going to step away.
			I had invested about a decade into my career, and I found myself at wit's end.
		</p>

		<p>
			More than not, there was stress. But stress isn't a bad thing.
			Anything worth it will be difficult to achieve or accomplish. So a stress-free experience in life
			is an impossibility. The stress I'd encounter centered around keeping up with assigned tickets,
			being considered a lead developer and keeping up with the other lead developers in both
			code contribution and being that legendary 'force multiplier' for your team. The latter being
			what your manager wanted; the former being what was baseline.
		</p>

		<p>
			What came to a head for me was the purpose of the stress. So the question to ask was:
			Why was I stressed?
		</p>

		<p>
			The answer was because I had work I needed to complete. Work needed to be done. Then I asked: Why
			do I care so much about the work? Because in reality, I didn't. I just wanted to be paid so I
			could continue saving up and continue to afford my modest lifestyle. I grew up without money, so
			I developed a certain frugality with a single-track mindset: Get money no matter what.
		</p>

		<p>
			That was my focus. That had been my <i>only</i> focus, arguably ever since I began to ponder
			about what I'd do after I was completely done with school. Getting a master's degree didn't seem
			too financially rewarding once I got my bachelor's. However, any other goal I had in mind fell
			to the wayside. The question of what I truly wanted to do was shelved. The priority was to get
			money. So I put my head down into the code and learned enough to work. I only applied to jobs
			so I could further my career. Out the gate, after graduation, the goal was to find a
			junior engineering position, which I did in a year.
		</p>

		<p>
			I didn't even care about the technology. I just wanted to be paid. I wanted to be better off
			than my family, and I managed to achieve that.
		</p>

		<p>
			"But to what end?" is what I asked myself once I got a grasp of setting up my retirement accounts.
			The idea of retiring in my golden years mathematically made sense. However, logic has a
			tendency to hit you with a fuller picture when you open your eyes for a bit and look outside
			your own experiences (or rather your own limited understanding of the world). This took
			the form of my mother - a woman who had dedicated over thirty years of her life to working as
			a nurse under a number of hospitals. Due to physical complications developed from needing to stand
			up for long periods of time and carefully handling patients by lifting them out of bed, while doing
			these things over night shifts, my mother needed to retire early. Her legs were a mess. She couldn't
			work anymore.
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't know the whole picture, but I do know she didn't get as much money as she could've if
			she had worked a year or two more and retired then. But she was touching on sixty, and
			younger nurses with more advanced nursing degrees than her were literally running circles around
			her. What purpose did she have left at her work? To get money? That was the answer back when I
			was a child and lived with her. But I was gone, so what was the point? So she left, and a good
			chunk of her potential retirement was taken away.
		</p>

		<p>
			Seeing that unfold made me reflect on my own experience with the reality of being a working adult.
			Loyalty from working a long time with someone doesn't mean much in the relationship between an
			organization that runs your workplace and you, the individual human that dedicated years of your
			life to it. Nobody looked at my mother's experience and figured she was worth an exception despite
			her making an exception for them. Those years are just as gone as the potential money.
		</p>

		<p>
			Looking at myself, I asked what was I doing. No, really. What was the purpose of my retirement?
			To retire with around a million bucks in my 60s? Who's to say I even reach that age? Or even if I do,
			how much would a million even afford me in those years? Inflation is already doing a number on
			the population. Nobody can buy a house if they didn't have one already. The Dollar Menu at
			McDonald's is gone and they're even taking away free refills. If that's not an indicator for
			the tumultuous nature of monetary value, then I don't know what else to say.
		</p>

		<p>
			And this is for a field I really didn't care about. As long as I got paid, I did whatever. Day in.
			Day out. Sometimes it was easy. Sometimes it wasn't. I grew to fiend for the easy days, lunch breaks,
			and the day to be over. I wanted to cruise.
		</p>

		<p>
			I didn't care. I cared about getting the job and doing just enough to be paid. But I didn't care.
			Didn't care about the job. Didn't care about the profession aside from my own reputation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Meanwhile, the world is burning. Kids are becoming stupider while being raised on social media if they're not
			outright dying.
			Food is becoming more artificial, expensive, and unhealthy. Companies have gotten so big that they
			must regurgitate whatever has historically made the biggest returns as much as they can while nickel-and-diming
			as many people as they can through all manners of subscriptions and piecemeal transactions.
			The government is 10 years behind on doing anything substantial for its citizens all while devoting
			resources to maintain international relationships that may or may not contradict fundamental tenets the government
			itself was built upon.
		</p>

		<p>
			And for me? I shelved whatever hopes, dreams, and interests I had in order to chase a dollar the 'right' way.
			Go to school. Get a job. Get paid.
		</p>

		<p>
			So I left my career.
		</p>

		<h2>Hiatus</h2>

		<p>In the time I've been away from working, I've dabbled here and there in a few things. I've acknowledged I have a
			void within me. That drive I once had in making things is a lot harder to muster; I'm so used to being assigned a
			task and
			needing to flesh it out. Then there's that toxic, persistent desire for perfection.
		</p>

		<p>I took up drawing for a bit. I got better at it than I ever was, but paused. It's something I really
			should get back into. It was fun when I was feeling it.
		</p>

		<p>
			I also got a bit more into game development. I even managed to make a few small browser games that
			may or may not see the light of day since they're extremely rough, but I'm proud of them since
			I did take the time to make them from scratch.
		</p>

		<p>
			But what has lasted the longest and has been the most consistent has been my focus on my physical health.
			The day I left my job, I got into jogging regularly. I started with Couch to 5K, completed that, and here
			I am now jogging three days a week. It's become a habit I never thought I would have.
		</p>

		<p>
			I also got back into weightlifting. I'm not as strong as I used to be back in my early twenties,
			but I have more energy (though my knees remind me how much time really has passed).
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm a healthier person. I've finally started to knock out that excess weight I obtained during
			the pandemic and now I'm down forty pounds with more of a tone I haven't had since, again,
			my college years.
		</p>

		<p>
			But even I know this is borrowed time. I've been living off my savings, which I hate thinking about.
		</p>

		<p>
			Currently, I've been hunting for a new job. But at the same time, I'm exploring alternatives.
			Freelancing is one angle I'd like to gain experience in. Given the skills I have from being a
			professional engineer, it seems I could shift them towards a personal freelancing business if I
			focused on it.
		</p>

		<p>
			I also began pulling old goals off the metaphorical shelves to see if the current version of myself
			can bring them into fruition. Being able to produce a deliverable and make even a cent off it would be a success
			in my eyes. A cent is more than nothing, and being paid for your ideas would be a new kind of achievement.
